PROJECT TITLE:              Password

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:         This class elicits passwords from the user and runs several tests on the passwords to ensure that they meet the minimum requirements.  If they fails any checks, a report is supposed to be printed out to tell the user what they did wrong in choosing their password.  If they pass the checks, a report will be printed out indicating as such.

VERSION or DATE:            08/27/2017

AUTHORS:                    Michael R. Boykin

USER INSTRUCTIONS:          Type a password.  It will ask if you have more to enter.  Type y/n or yes/no (not case sensitive).  When done, it will check the validity of the password and a report generated.
